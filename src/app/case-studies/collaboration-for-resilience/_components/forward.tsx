      <h3>WAY FORWARD</h3>
      <p>
        The Partnership looks forward to reviewing the results and continuing to align and strengthen continental resource mobilization for EPR. Additionally, an extensive exercise is underway to
        document this experience, celebrating the power of collective action, highlighting lessons learned and providing a playbook that other regions can replicate and adapt. The JEAP will actively
        disseminate and utilize this playbook to help ensure that countries are prepared for the next round of the Pandemic Fund and related opportunities.
