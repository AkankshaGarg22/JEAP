        <p className="py-2 font-bold w-[80%]">The close working partnership between Africa CDC and WHO allows for highly coordinated and complementary support to the network. Africa CDC provides technical training, sources equipment, and is developing a real-time data-sharing platform to strengthen the capacity of the network. WHO AFRO, through its country offices, acts as a broker, facilitating agreements, navigating customs, and organizing logistics to ensure samples arrive cold and intact for processing. This strong partnership has enabled the establishment of a network of 13 Centers of Excellence (CoEs) serving as sequencing hubs across the continent.</p> <p className="py-2 font-bold w-[80%]"> Underpinning these efforts, there is a need for strong and harmonious laboratory systems overall. The JEAP has supported the strengthening of the broad laboratory system in Africa by developing a continental guideline for sample referral and ensuring a coordinated network for transporting samples for confirmation of priority pathogens. In November 2023, the Africa CDC introduced a laboratory network information management system to monitor and facilitate informed decision-making on network operations.17</p>

          <p className="text-white">Regular coordination between the Africa CDC and WHO has also helped optimize supply chains for critical laboratory resources like reagents, maximizing the networkâ€™s efficiency. For example, the JEAP partnership combined reagents delivered in an Africa CDC starter pack with supplementary reagents from WHO to enable the testing of a broader array of samples.</p>
