It has equipped me with the skills and confidence to address sensitivity issues tactfully and effectively, ensuring that every person I assist feels safe and valued. I can now be more watchful, kind, and proactive, making sure that everyone's safety and respect come first in every situation thanks to this training.",

        "Article 23 of the Namibia Constitution acknowledges that women were previously disadvantaged in many areas of life. Therefore, the Government of the Republic of Namibia endeavors to break the historical gender imbalances by adopting a proportional representation system that is more favourable to womenâ€™s representation. Recruiting many women to the Namibia pool of emergency responders was an obvious choice for us, since we know that having a variety of women and men's perspectives can enhance the quality of care on the ground. As the African Proverb says: You educate a man, you educate an individual; you educate a woman, you educate a generation. We believe that gender equal participation in the workforce will lead to a more effective response for the communities who need our help.",
