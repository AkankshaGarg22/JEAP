        Activities that have been completed so far demonstrate the potential for the Partnershipâ€™s impact. For example, in the workforce development collaboration area, which has the longest history,
        the Partnership demonstrated the power of pooling regional resources by jointly training 1,350 AVoHC-SURGE emergency responders, with 14 countries now deploying these responders. This has
        resulted in immeasurable impact at the country level, with AVoHC-SURGE teams contributing to timely and effective response to and closure of emergencies.

      <p className="text-center max-w-7xl xl:text-[20px]">
        In response readiness and coordination, the Partnership launched a key regional tool to strengthen emergency coordination: the first-ever multistakeholder Strategic Plan for Strengthening
        Public Health Emergency Operations Centres in Member States of Africa and Eastern Mediterranean Region. The Partnership is now actively supporting Member States to adapt the strategy to
        national contexts and begin implementation.

      <p className="text-center max-w-7xl xl:text-[20px]">
        Other highlights across collaboration areas include conducting joint advocacy to secure blanket customs clearance to speed up the delivery of essential medicines, facilitating cross-border
        simulation exercises, and joining forces to operate a pan-African network of 12 specialized laboratories across the continent to enhance genomic sequencing. Implementation progress is
        described in more detail for each Collaboration Area in the following sections. Across all Collaboration Areas, capacity building efforts were a focus of the first year and will continue to be
        prioritized to encourage sustainability.
